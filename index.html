        <p>
            While Vatican City is home to the Roman Catholic Churchâ€™s governing body and its head, the pope, 
            this small sovereign city-state within Rome offers a wealth of cultural attractions open to visitors of any faith.
             No visit to the Vatican City would be complete without visiting <b>the world-famous Vatican Museums</b>.
              They display works from the immense <b>collection</b> amassed by the <b>Catholic Church </b>and the papacy throughout the centuries including several of the most renowned <b>Roman sculptures</b>
               and most important masterpieces of Renaissance art in the world.
