            The Vintage and Classic Car Museum, or Vintage & Classic Car Collection was unveiled to general public on 15 February 2000. 
            It was inaugurated by <b>Lord Montagu of Beaulieu</b>, founder of the National Motor Museum in England.
            The Vintage & Classic Car Collection is a car collection and a museum, showing all the vehicles belonging to the Maharanas of Mewar both past and present. 
            The collection is housed in the original former <b>Mewar State Motor Garage</b>, which currently serves as this museum. 
            Garden Hotel and Restaurant, a property of HRH Group of Hotels, Udaipur, is also contained within the garage's grounds. 
            The semi-circular motor garage with its forecourt is housed within a greater courtyard. It also houses one of the original Shell petrol pump, which is still assumed to be in usable condition.
             <b>Despite some vehicles being over seventy years old, each one is still kept in working condition.</b>
