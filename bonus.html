        <p>
            While the Mariner Moose was the Mariners' first full-time mascot, the team previously held a mascot competition in 1979 in response to the popularity of the San Diego Chicken.
            The winner of the competition was "Spacey the Needle," which was a man that wore a hat resembling the top of the Space Needle while on stilts; a man in a diaper took second place.
